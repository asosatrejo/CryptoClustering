- [ ] Code the elbow method algorithm to find the best value for k. Use a range from 1 to 11.
- [ ] To visually identify the optimal value for k, plot a line chart of all the inertia values computed with the different values of k.
- [ ] Answer the following question: Whatâ€™s the best value for k?

- [ ] Initialize the K-means model with four clusters by using the best value for k. 
- [ ] Fit the K-means model by using the original data. 
- [ ] Predict the clusters for grouping the cryptocurrencies by using the original data. Review the resulting array of cluster values.
- [ ] Create a copy of the original data, and then add a new column of the predicted clusters. 
- [ ] Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting x="price_change_percentage_24h" and y="price_change_percentage_7d". Color the graph points with the labels that you found by using K-means. Then add the crypto name to the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency that each data point represents. 
## Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis 
- [ ] Create a PCA model instance, and set n_components=3. 
- [ ] Use the PCA model to reduce the features to three principal components. Then review the first five rows of the DataFrame. 
- [ ] Get the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component. 
- [ ] Answer the following question: Whatâ€™s the total explained variance of the three principal components? 
- [ ] Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data. Be sure to set the coin_id index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame. Review the resulting DataFrame.

- [ ] To visually identify the optimal value for k, plot a line chart of all the inertia values computed with the different values of k. 
- [ ] Answer the following questions: Whatâ€™s the best value for k when using the PCA data? Does it differ from the best value for k that you found by using the original data?

- [ ] Initialize the K-means model with four clusters by using the best value for k. 
- [ ] Fit the K-means model by using the PCA data. 
- [ ] Predict the clusters for grouping the cryptocurrencies by using the PCA data. Review the resulting array of cluster values. 
- [ ] Create a copy of the DataFrame with the PCA data, and then add a new column to store the predicted clusters. 
- [ ] Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting x="PC1" and y="PC2". Color the graph points with the labels that you found by using K-means. Then add the crypto name to the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency that each data point represents. 
## Visualize and Compare the Results 
- [ ] Create a composite plot by using hvPlot and the plus sign (+) operator to compare the elbow curve that you created from the original data with the one that you created from the PCA data. 
- [ ] Create a composite plot by using hvPlot and the plus (+) operator to compare the cryptocurrency clusters that resulted from using the original data with those that resulted from the PCA data. 
- [ ] Answer the following question: Based on visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, whatâ€™s the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data by using K-means? (5 points)
## Coding Conventions and Formatting 
- [ ] Place imports at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings, and before module globals and constants. 
- [ ] Name functions and variables with lowercase characters, with words separated by underscores. 
- [ ] Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, creating maintainable and reusable code. 
- [ ] Use concise logic and creative engineering where possible. 
## Deployment and Submission 
- [ ] Submit a link to a GitHub repository thatâ€™s cloned to your local machine and that contains your files. 
- [ ] Use the command line to add your files to the repository. 
- [ ] Include appropriate commit messages in your files. 
## Code Comments 
- [ ] Be well commented with concise, relevant notes that other developers can understand.
